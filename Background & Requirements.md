# Excel-Dashboard-Novatech-Solutions-Gadget-Sales
A dynamic Excel dashboard designed to visualize sales performance, track KPIs, and analyze trends using Pivot Tables and interactive slicers

## Background 
### Client story
Novatech Solutions currently relies on an outdated ERP system to manage its inventory, invoicing, and quotations. 
While the system captures basic transactional data, it is limited to monthly aggregated reports and lacks advanced analytical capabilities.

The existing inventory and sales module provides summaries such as:

- Invoice date
- Quarter and month
- Client name
- Units sold
- Invoice value
- Cash received

These reports are usually generated on a monthly basis and presented in tabular format. Although this gives the management team a high-level view of sales activity, it does not provide actionable insights into:
- Receivables owed by individual clients
- How those receivables stack up against already paid invoices
- Client-level turnover over time
- Payment behavior trends
- Performance comparison across months, quarters, or clients

As Novatech prepares to launch a new client loyalty and incentive program, management faces a major challenge:
they cannot confidently determine which clients are most valuable, most consistent, or most reliable in payments based on the fragmented monthly summaries available.

Decision-making is currently constrained because:

- Data is siloed by month
- There is no consolidated view of receivables
- Trends are not visible
- Performance is not easily comparable across clients or periods
- Management has to go through months of ERP reports to make a decision per client

To enable a more strategic decision, management has requested a high-level visual dashboard that presents the bigger picture of client performance, receivables, and cash flow—without overwhelming detail.
The dashboard should provide just enough insight to guide decisions around the proposed loyalty and incentive program.

### The Objective of this project
To deliver a simple dashboard that enables management to:
- Assess client performance at a glance
- Understand cash inflows versus outstanding receivables
- Identify high-performing and high-risk clients
- Track trends across months and quarters
- Make informed decisions on incentive eligibility

### Dashboard Requirements
**1. Filters**

The dashboard should include the following interactive filters:
- Client
- Quarter
- Month
These filters should dynamically update all charts and summaries on the dashboard.

**2. Key Visualizations**
a. Total Invoice Value vs Total Cash Received (By Month)

b. Total Cash Received (By Quarter)

c. Cash Received vs Outstanding Balance (By Month)

d. Cash Received vs Outstanding Balance (By Client)

**3. Summary KPIs (Minimal & Decision-Focused)**

The dashboard should include a small summary section showing the total units sold by the team.
This is a key deciding factor for the overall incentive program.

## Expected Outcome

With this dashboard, Novatech Solutions’ management will:

- Gain a clear, consolidated view of sales and receivables
- Quickly identify top-performing and high-risk clients
- Understand trends across months and quarters
- Make data-driven decisions for the new loyalty and incentive program
